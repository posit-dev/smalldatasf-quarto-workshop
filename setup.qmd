## Publishing accounts

You do not need to publish your dashboard during the workshop, but it would be good practice!

To publish your website you'll need an account on one of Quarto's publishing venues:

-   **(Recommended)** [Quarto Pub](https://quartopub.com/sign-up)
-   [GitHub](https://github.com) only **if you are already** a Git/GitHub user

## Discord

We're not going to be making heavy use of Discord during the workshop, but it's a great place to share code snippets for questions that come up or (inevitable) typos that need to be fixed.

More importantly, it's a great place to connect with other conference attendees.
